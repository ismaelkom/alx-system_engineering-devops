#!/bin/bash
ls -la,cd ..,ls -la,cd /boot,ls -la
Save this script to a file, for example, list_files.sh, and make it executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x list_files.sh
Running the script with ./list_files.sh will list all files, including hidden ones, in long format for the current directory, the parent directory of the working directory, and the /boot directory, in that order.
